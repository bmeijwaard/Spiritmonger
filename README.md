# Spiritmonger
## The NicFit library

NicFit is one of the most flexible archetypes within the Legacy landscape. Some find it to be a meme. Others, like myself, invest finding new ways to play this beautiful architype. Constantly looking for that unfound gem that would break the deck. 
But must of the time, myself and others, tend to try the tried. Conclude the concluded. And fail where others have failed before.

Just like the card Spiritmonger, there where others that shined in the past, not doing any more so. So those should remain as past.

## What is does
This project is all about generating a library that NicFit enthoussiasts can use to check what the community thinks about a card before including it in their deck. 

## Work in progress
This project is a pet project to put some spare time in. Obviously it is open source.
For now i have included part of a third party project (also (partially) opensource) to retrieve card information.
